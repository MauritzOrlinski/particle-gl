# ParticleGL

> A particle simulation written in C using OpenGL for graphics

## Summary

I used this project to get first experience in graphics programming.

## Physics

I'm using Newtonian mechanics for computing the next position based on the current state.
For collision handling I'm using elastic 2D-Collision handling (check for more information:
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elastic_collision))
